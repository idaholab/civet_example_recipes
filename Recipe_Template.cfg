# Main section. Required. This sets global properties on the recipe and specifies when this recipe is triggered.

# build_user: The user that will be running CIVET client.
build_user = moosebuild
# repository: The repository on which CIVET will listen for events to trigger this recipe
repository = git@github.com:idaholab/moose
# name: name of the recipe. Used for a more descriptive name that is shown on the user's recipe page
name = Moose Tutorial
# display_name: A shorter name that will be displayed for CIVET jobs
display_name = Tutorial
# help: Some help text describing what this recipe does
help = Builds and runs the MOOSE tutorial
# active: Bool. If False then this recipe won't be triggered
active = True
# private: Bool. If True then the results of this recipe are only viewable by collaborators.

# trigger_push: Bool. If True then this recipe will be triggered on a push to the branch specified in trigger_push_branch
trigger_push = True
# trigger_push_branch: Branch name to trigger on push
trigger_push_branch = master
# priority_push: Priority for this recipe when it is triggered by a push.
# Priority determines in what order jobs are run. Higher priorities run first.
priority_push = 3
# auto_cancel_on_new_push: Bool. If True then when a new push event comes in, it will automatically cancel 
# any previous running jobs that use this recipe (that got triggered on a push event).
auto_cancel_on_new_push = True
# automatic: One of "manual", "automatic", or "authorized".
#         "manual": The job will have to be manually activated by a collaborator before it can be run
#         "automatic": The job automatically is scheduled to run (when dependencies are set)
#         "authorized": The job automatically is scheduled to run if the initiated user is a collaborator
automatic = automatic
# build_configs: A list of configurations that this recipe should be run against. Lists are comma separated.

# allow_on_pr: If True then a user can select this recipe to be run on a pull request (if it isn't already triggered on a PR)
allow_on_pr = True
# trigger_pull_request: If True then this recipe is triggered on pull requests
trigger_pull_request = True
# priority_pull_request: Priority for this recipe when it is triggered by a pull request.
# Priority determines in what order jobs are run. Higher priorities run first.

# trigger_manual: Bool. If True then this recipe will be triggered via a manual event.
#       This is typically used via cron that does a simple post to a URL to trigger this event.
#       You will also need to specify trigger_manual_branch to specify what branch this will happen on.
#       The latest SHA on that branch will be what this recipe operates on.
trigger_manual = True
# trigger_manual_branch: The branch to operate on a manual event

#trigger_release: Bool. If True then this recipe will be triggered when there is a release event.

# client_runner_user: Username of the user that will be running the client.
#        This is intended for the case where an outside user is going to be running a client
#        and reporting it back to the main civet server. This will be different than the build_user.

# create_issue_on_fail: Bool. If True and the recipe fails on a push or manual event, it automatically
#        creates an issue on the git server.

# create_issue_on_fail_message: A string that will get added to the message on create_issue_on_fail
create_issue_on_fail_message = True
# create_issue_on_fail_new_comment: Bool. The default behavior for create_issue_on_fail is to just update the
#        issue if they issue already exists. Setting this option to True will create a new comment if the
#        issue already exists. This is useful because the git server will typically send
#        out a new notification on new comments but not on updates to issues.
create_issue_on_fail_new_comment = True

# activate_label: Some arbitrary label name. This label gets attached to the recipe and allows for filtering
#        of recipes on the server side.
#        For example, the server can run only recipes that match a certain label if a certain set of files changed.
#        For MOOSE, we have MOOSE_DOCUMENTATION label on the documentation recipe and that is the only thing that
#        gets run on a PR when only documentation changes.
activate_label = <label>
